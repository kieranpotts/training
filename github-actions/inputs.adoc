= Inputs

Inputs enable us to request specific information from the caller of the workflow
or action, and use this information at runtime.

The `inputs` attribute is a top-level key in both workflow and action YAML files.
Each entry, `inputs.<name>`, represents an individual input value. The input
value becomes available in the workflow via the `inputs` context.

.Action
[source,yaml]
----
inputs:
  url:
    description: '...'
    required: true
  max-tries:
    description: '...'
    required: false
    default: 3
----

.Caller
[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  job1:
    steps:
      - name: Ping URL
        uses: ping-url-example@v1
        with:
          url: https://example.com
          max-tries: 5

In manually-triggered workflows, inputs are defined under the `workflow_dispatch`
event, defined via the top-level `on` key. Likewise, for reusable workflows,
inputs are defined under the `workflow_call` event.
