= Functions

Via link:./expressions.adoc[expressions], runners dynamically inject various
functions into workflows, allowing for querying of information about the
workflow run, doing comparisons, and transforming data.

A classic use case for a function is `fromJSON()`, to convert variables from
strings to complex data structures.

There are two categories of functions:

* *General-purpose functions*: utility functions to interact with data from
  multiple contexts and to model complex behavior, such as more advanced
  control over the workflow and job execution. Examples include:

  ** `contains()`: : checks if a value contains another value; returns `true`
         if the search value is found in the target value.
  ** `startsWith()`: checks if a string starts with a specified substring;
         returns true if the string starts with the given substring.
  ** `endsWith()`: checks if a string ends with a specified substring.
  ** `fromJSON()`: converts a value into a JSON object or data type; it's used
         to work with JSON data in expressions or convert environment variables
         from strings to JSON.
  ** `toJSON()`: converts a value into a JSON string.
  ** `hashFiles()`: used to generate a hash based on a single or multiple files;
         one use-case is to generate caching keys based on dependency lock files.
  ** `format()`: used to format a string with placeholders.
  ** â€¦

* *Status-check functions*: allow using the status of the workflow, or previous
  jobs or steps, to define conditionals for the execution of subsequent parts
  of the workflow. The available status-check functions are:

  ** `success()`: returns `true` when none of the previous steps have failed or
         been cancelled.
  ** `failure()`: returns `true` when any previous step of a job fails.
  ** `cancelled()`: returns `true` if the workflow was cancelled.
  ** `always()`: always returns `true` and ensures that a step executes, even
         if previous steps failed or if the workflow was cancelled.

[TIP]
======
`!cancelled()` is particularly useful. It will execute jobs or steps even if
the previous jobs or steps failed, but not if the workflow run itself was
cancelled.

== Type conversions

GitHub Actions automatically converts data types when working with functions:

* *Null*: Converts to an empty string `''`.
* *Boolean*: Converts to `'true'` or `'false'`.
* *Number*: Converts to decimal format or exponential notation for large numbers.
* *Array*: Not converted to a string.
* *Object*: Not converted to a string.
