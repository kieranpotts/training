== Overview

Each link:./jobs.adoc[job] has steps to complete.

Steps are sequential operations and tasks that are executed in a job.

Each step may be a shell command or a reference to an link:./actions.adoc[action].

== Conditionals

As with link:./jobs.adoc[jobs], execution of individual steps can be made
conditional.

By default, the standard execution for steps within a job is for downstream steps
to be executed only if the upstream steps succeed.

In the following example, if step2 fails, step3 will not execute:

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  job1:
    steps:
      - id: step1
        run: echo "Step 1"
      - id: step2
        run: echo "Step 2"
      - id: step3
        run: echo "Step 3"
----

If we wanted to always run `step3` even if prior steps fail, we can use
`!cancelled()`. Now, step3 will always be run, even if step1 or step2 fails
(but not if the whole workflow is cancelled):

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  job1:
    steps:
      - id: step1
      - id: step2
      - id: step3
        if: ${{ !cancelled() }}
----

The `if` attribute can be used to make a step conditional. The step will only run
if the expression evaluates to `true`. The `${{ }}` expression syntax MAY be
omitted in most cases, but it is RECOMMENDED to keep it, wrapping all
expressions for clarity and consistency.

Contexts are commonly used in conditional expressions. In the following
example, the build and test step will run only when the workflow is triggered
by a push event:

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Build and test
      if: github.event_name == 'push'
      run: |
        # Your build and test commands here
        echo "Building and testing..."
----

In the following example, the deployment will happen only when the push event
occurs on the `main` branch:

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Deploy to production
      if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
      run: |
        echo "Deploying to production..."
----

== Using actions from steps

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  example-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout the repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run a custom script
        run: ./my-script.sh
----

For documentation on creating custom actions, see link:./actions.adoc[Actions].

== Running shell commands in steps

The simplest type of workflows consist of steps that use the `run` attribute
to define shell commands, which will be run directly in the runner.

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
name: Hello world

on:
  - workflow_dispatch

jobs:
  hello_world:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: "Say hello"
        run: echo "Hello world"
----

Multiple shell commands can be run in a single step:

[source,yaml]
----
steps:
  - name: Print messages
    run: |
      echo "Message 1"
      echo "Message 2"
      echo "Message 3"
----

For anything more complex than a few lines of code, it is RECOMMENDED to
extract the script to a standalone `.sh` file and reference it from `run`:

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  example-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run a script
        run: ./my-script.sh
        shell: bash
----

Optionally, you can specify an alternative working directory for all external
scripts:

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  example-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: ./scripts
    steps:
      - name: Run a script
        run: ./my-script.sh
        shell: bash
----

A common pattern is to use scripts as reusable actions that are relevant only
to the current repository, and a convention is to store these scripts in
`./.github/scripts`.

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  example-job:
    steps:
      - name: Run build script
        run: ./.github/scripts/build.sh
        shell: bash
----

=== Setting outputs

[source,yaml]
----
steps:
  - name: Set output
    id: output_step
    run: echo "result=output_value" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

  - name: Use output
    run: echo "Output is ${{ steps.output_step.outputs.result }}"
----

See link:./outputs.adoc[Outputs] for more information.

=== Setting environment variables

[source,yaml]
----
steps:
  - name: Set env vars
    run: |
      echo "ACTION_ENV=production" >> $GITHUB_ENV
----

=== Extending the system path

[source,yaml]
----
steps:
  - name: Add dir to PATH
    run: |
      echo "/path/to/dir" >> $GITHUB_PATH
----

=== Logging

To enable step debug logging, set the `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` secret or variable
to `true` in the repository that contains the workflow. (If both the secret and
variable are set, the value of the secret takes precedence over the variable.)

[source,yaml]
----
steps:
  - name: Create debug message
    run: echo "::debug::This is a debug message"
----

Log messages can be grouped. This makes logs easier to read:

[source,yaml]
----
steps:
  - name: Group log messages
    run: |
      echo "::group::My grouped messages"
      echo "Message 1"
      echo "Message 2"
      echo "::endgroup::"
----

You can mask values in logs, preventing sensitive information from appearing
there:

[source,yaml]
----
steps:
  - name: Mask secret
    run: echo "::add-mask::${{ secrets.MY_SECRET_VALUE }}"
----

And you can use `::error::` to force a workflow to stop:

[source,yaml]
----
steps:
  - name: Force error and fail the workflow
    run: echo "::error::This is an error message"
----

The `::` syntax is called a *workflow command*, and it is a way of communicating
with the runner to print formatted lines of text code to the console log.
Workflow commands can be used within shell commands executed directly from
workflow steps or via actions.
