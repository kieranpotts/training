== Overview

Actions – not be confused with "GitHub Actions", which happens to also be the
brand name for the overall CI/CD service offered by GitHub – can be thought of
as shareable packaged commands that can be reused across multiple workflows.

An action is plugged in to a link:./steps.adoc[step] in a link:./jobs.adoc[job].
See links:./steps.adoc[steps] for instructions to call an action from a step.

An action may encapsulate multiple steps and commands, and indeed it may be
run in an entirely different environment from the rest of the job from which
the action is called.

There is an extensive marketplace of open source actions, and it is RECOMMENDED
to reuse existing actions (whether public ones or your own private library of
actions) wherever possible. This reduces code duplication and decreases the
chances of mistakes and bugs.

== Using actions

[source,yaml]
----
name: My NPM package workflow
on: push
jobs:
 node-20-release:
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
   steps:
     - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
       with:
         node-version: 20
     - run: npm ci
     - run: npm test
     - run: npm publish ...
----

Actions are configured via `with` key-value pairs, which is basically the
action's input arguments.

The remainder of this documentation is concerned with the _creation_ of
custom actions, rather than their consumption from workflow steps.
See also the {link-docs-gh-actions-syntax}[metadata syntax for actions].

== Public vs private actions

Actions can be published publicly or privately.

*Public actions* can be used in workflows defined in any repository. Public
actions are stored in their own repositories, rather than bundled with
application code in project repositories. This allows you to version, track and
release the actions independently of the workflows that use them.

*Private actions* are those defined in private repositories, and they can be
used only in workflows in the same repository. With private actions, the
action's file can be stored in any location in the repository, though it is
recommended to use `.github/actions` to keep things consistent.

[IMPORTANT]
======
Public actions MUST be in their own repository if you want them to be reused
by other repositories.
======

== Action types

There are three types of GitHub actions:

* *Container actions*: The runtime environment configuration is included in
  the action's package. These actions can be run only in a Linux environment
  in a GitHub-hosted runner. Any programming language can be used, because you
  can configure the container however you like. Uses Docker.

* *JavaScript actions*: You specify a particular version of Node, but otherwise
  you do not include the environment in your action's code. These actions are run
  in a VM, which can be hosted by a GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runner.
  JavaScript actions support Linux, macOS, and Windows environments.

* *Composite actions*: These actions are a way to combine multiple commands,
  across multiple workflow steps, within a single action. This means that client
  workflows can bundle all of the action's commands into a single step.

In general, JavaScript actions are best for fast, simple tasks, while container
actions are best for more complex tasks that require specific environments –
they tend to be a bit slower because the job has to retrieve the image and build
the container from it.

Composite actions are the easiest of all. These are just shell scripts that are
run in the same environment as the rest of the workflow. You can even mix
multiple shell languages within the same action. Sometimes it's just easier to
write a simple shell script than to use JavaScript or wrap your code in a
Docker container!

[NOTE]
======
Docker containers can be run only in Linux, and only in GitHub-hosted runners.
But both JavaScript and composite actions can be run in Linux, macOS, and
Windows.
======

The `using` attribute determines the action type. The following example is a
JavaScript action because it is using the `node20` runtime environment, and
because the main entry point for this action is a `.js` file.

[source,yaml]
----
runs:
  using: 'node20'
  main: 'main.js'
----

All actions require a metadata file to define the inputs and outputs, and the
main entry point, for the action.

=== Docker container actions

To create a Docker container action, you will need to create:

* A `Dockerfile`, which defines the commands to assemble the Docker image.
* An `action.y(a)ml` file, which defines the metadata for the actions, such as
  its inputs and outputs. The following configuration is required:

[source,yaml]
----
runs:
  using: docker
  image: Dockerfile
----

* An `entrypoint.sh` file, which is the script that runs when the container
  starts.
* And a `README.md` file.

A README is RECOMMENDED – and sometimes REQUIRED, in the case of actions published
to the GitHub Marketplace – and SHOULD include the following information:

* A detailed description of what the action does.
* Required input and output arguments.
* Optional input and output arguments.
* Secrets the action uses.
* Environment variables the action uses.
* An example of how to use your action in a workflow.

In addition, README files should include recommendations about how users should
reference the action in their workflows, including versioning recommendations.

=== JavaScript actions

JavaScript actions require knowledge of the Node.js runtime environment and
the JavaScript programming language. But any kind of custom language is possible,
and happily there is a whole ecosystem of NPM packages in the `@actions/*`
namespace that provide lots of useful functionality, so you often don't
need to write everything from scratch.

The steps to create a JavaScript action are:

* Create an `action.y(a)ml` metadata file, which defines the action's inputs and
  outputs.
* Create an `index.js` file, which is the main entry point for the action and
  defines or imports all of its functions.
* Optionally create a `package.json` file, if there are dependencies that need
  to be installed. (The generated package-lock.json file should also be
  committed and, unusually, the `node_modules` directory also needs to be
  committed!)

[TIP]
======
To create and use packaged JavaScript actions, you MUST download Node.js, which
includes npm, onto the runner. A RECOMMENDED step is to use GitHub Actions
Toolkit Node.js, which is a collection of Node.js packages that allows you to
quickly build JavaScript actions with more consistency.
======

=== Composite actions

Composite actions are the simplest type of custom actions. They can be used to
group together multiple steps and commands, augmented by other actions (of
any type). However, they may not be enough for complex functionality.

== Metadata

The `action.y(a)ml` file defines the following information about your action:

[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Description | Required

| Name
| The name of the action, which helps to identify it within the context of a job.
| Yes

| Description
| A summary of what the action does.
| Yes

| Runs
| The command to run when the action executes.
| Yes

| Inputs
| Input parameters which the action expects to receive during runtime; the inputs become env vars in the runner.
| No

| Outputs
| Output parameters allow you to specify data that subsequent steps in the workflow can use.
| No

| Branding
| Color and Feather icon, used to create a badge for the action in the GitHub Marketplace.
| No
|===

=== Runs

The `runs` statement defines the command necessary to execute the action. The
syntax varies depending on the action type.

For Docker actions, `runs.using` needs to be set to "docker", and `runs.image`
references either "Dockerfile" or the name of the Docker image.

[source,yaml]
----
runs:
  using: 'docker'
  image: 'Dockerfile'
----

For JavaScript actions, `runs.using` needs to be set to "node12" or "node14", etc.,
and `runs.main` references the main entry point for the action.

[source,yaml]
----
runs:
  using: 'node12'
  main: 'main.js'
----

For composite actions, `runs.using` needs to be set to "composite"; `runs.steps`
defines the action's steps; and `steps[*].run` defines the commands you want to
run, which could be inline or in script files.

[source,yaml]
----
runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - run: ${{ github.action_path }}/test/script.sh
      shell: bash
----

=== Inputs and outputs

The `inputs` attribute specifies data that the action requires during its
runtime.

[source,yaml]
----
inputs:
  num-octocats:
    description: 'Number of Octocats'
    required: false
    default: '1'
  octocat-eye-color:
    description: 'Eye color of the Octocats'
    required: true
----

The `outputs` attribute allows you to declare data that the action sets. Later
steps in the workflow can use the output data from previously-run actions.

[source,yaml]
----
outputs:
  sum: # id of the output variable.
    description: 'The sum of the inputs'
----

=== Branding

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
branding:
  icon: 'shield'
  color: 'blue'
----

== Exit codes

You can use exit codes to set the status of an action.

Example with a Bash script:

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

make build
exit_status=$?

if [ $exit_status -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "::error::Build failed with exit code $exit_status"
  exit $exit_status
fi

echo "::set-output name=status::success"
exit 0
----

Example with Docker:

[source,sh]
----
#!/bin/sh -l

echo "API_KEY=abc123" >> $GITHUB_ENV

./run-tests.sh
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "::error::Tests failed"
  exit 1
fi

echo "test-result=passed" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

echo "Action completed successfully"
----

The advantage of using exit codes is that consumers of the action can
respond to those exit codes in their workflows and customize how they respond
to them.

== Files and directories

GitHub provides some recommendations for organizing the code for your custom
actions. One or more custom actions can be stored in a single repository
(ie. a monorepo). The root directory of the repository should contain a
subdirectory for each action, named after the action. Inside, you'll organize
the action's source code and configuration files.

----
/your-action-name
  /node_modules
  action.yaml
  index.js
  package.json
  README.md
----

Each action SHOULD also have a `README.md` file with usage instructions.

Actions MUST have an `action.y(a)ml` file at the root of the action's directory.
This is the metadata file that defines the action's input and outputs, and its
main entry point:

[source,yaml]
----
name: 'My JS action'
description: 'A description of my JS action'
inputs:
  myInput:
    description: 'A description of my input'
    required: true
    default: 'default value'
outputs:
  myOutput:
    description: 'A description of my output'
runs:
  using: 'node12'
  main: 'index.js'
----

For JavaScript actions you MUST have a `package.json` file at the root of the
action, and an `index|main.js` file which is referenced from the `action.yaml`
file.

For Docker actions, the following filesystem structure is typical:

----
/your-docker-action-name
  Dockerfile
  entrypoint.sh
  action.yaml
  README.md
----

Example `action.yaml` for a Docker action:

[source,yaml]
----
name: 'My Docker action'
description: 'A description of my Docker action'
inputs:
  myInput:
    description: 'A description of my input'
    required: true
outputs:
  myOutput:
    description: 'A description of my output'
runs:
  using: 'docker'
  image: 'Dockerfile'
  args:
    - ${{ inputs.myInput }}
----

== Publishing actions to the GitHub Marketplace

Public actions can be published to the GitHub Marketplace, to share with the
GitHub community. Requirements for listing actions in the marketplace include:

* Each action MUST be in its own repository, which MUST be public. This allows
  you to release and tag actions independently.

* The repository MUST only include the code and configuration necessary for the
  action, and nothing else.

* The `action.y(a)ml` metadata file MUST be in the repository's root directory.

* The `name` of the action MUST be unique to the GitHub Marketplace. There are
  other restrictions, such as not clashing with GitHub users, organizations, or
  features.

* It is RECOMMENDED to create a README file for your action which includes a
  description, input/output arguments, secrets, environment variables, and workflow
  examples. This makes it easier for other users to understand what the action does
  and how to customize it.

* Public actions MUST be versioned. Two or three digit Semantic Versioning
  is REQUIRED.

These restrictions do not apply for actions intended for private use. Even
if you use public repositories for your own private/internal-use actions, as
long as those actions are not published to GitHub's Marketplace, you have a
lot more flexibility over how you design and manage your actions. For example,
you are free to encapsulate multiple actions in a single repository, and
there are no restrictions on how you name them.

== Examples of popular open source actions

* `actions/checkout`: checkout the repository into the runner environment.
* `actions/create-release`: create a release.
* `actions/delete-package-versions`: prune older versions of packages when publishing new ones.
* `actions/upload-release-asset`: upload a release asset.
* `actions/setup-node`: set up a Node.js environment.
* `actions/setup-python`: set up a Python environment.
* `actions/setup-java`: set up a Java environment.
* `azure/login`: authenticate with Azure.
* `azure/docker-login`: authenticate with your private Docker image registry in Azure.
* `azure/webapps-deploy`: deploy to Azure Web Apps.
* `docker/login-action`: login to the Docker container registry.
* `docker/metadata-action`: extract metadata (tags and labels) for Docker image.
* `docker/build-push-action`: build and push Docker images.
* `pullreminders/label-when-approved-action`: add a label to a PR once it has been approved.

.Example
[source,yaml]
----
steps:
 - name: Label when approved
   uses: pullreminders/label-when-approved-action@main
   env:
     APPROVALS: "1"
     # The action needs this because it will make changes to the repository:
     GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
     ADD_LABEL: "approved"
----

=== The CodeQL action

Using the CodeQL actions in workflows can automate the process of code
analysis, allowing you to find and fix security issues.

[source,yaml]
----
steps:
  - name: Checkout code
    uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - name: Initialize CodeQL
    uses: github/codeql-action/init@v1
    with:
      languages: ${{ matrix.language }}
  - name: Perform CodeQL analysis
    uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v1
----
