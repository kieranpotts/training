You can define configuration variables, environment variables, and secrets in
your workflows, to customize and parameterize each workflow's behavior. Use
cases for variables include:

* Accessing sensitive information securely.
* Defining parameters or configuration settings to dynamically control workflow
  behavior.
* Sharing information between workflow steps or jobs.

== Secrets

[IMPORTANT]
======
Even in private repositories, you SHOULD NOT expose sensitive information in
workflow files. GitHub Secrets is a secure place to store sensitive information
that your workflows need. Secrets are available within workflow files via the
`secrets` context.
======

Secrets are encrypted variables that allow you to pass sensitive information
to your GitHub Actions workflows.

Secrets can be defined at three levels:

* *Organization-level secrets*: to share secrets between multiple repositories;
  you can use policies to control which repositories can use organization
  secrets; updating organization secrets propagates the change to all shared
  repositories.

* *Repository-level secrets*: secrets that are shared across all workflow
  environments for a single repository.

* *Environment-level secrets*: secrets that are specific to a single workflow;
  you can enable required reviewers to approve changes to environment secrets.

Lower-level secrets override higher-level secrets.

Secret names MUST contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores. Secret
names MUST NOT start with number, and names MUST NOT started with the `GITHUB_`
prefix, which is reserved.

Names are case-insensitive, and they must be unique at the level they are at
which they are declared.

Secrets can be set via the GitHub web UI or the `gh` CLI tool. To set
repository-level secrets:

[source,sh]
----
# Set a secret, prompts for secret value:
gh secret set SECRET_NAME

# Set a secret and pass in the value from a text file:
gh secret set SECRET_NAME < secret.txt
----

To set at the environment level:

[source,sh]
----
# Prompts for secret value:
gh secret set --env ENV_NAME SECRET_NAME

# Get list of secrets for an environment:
gh secret list --env ENV_NAME
----

To set organization-level secrets:

[source,sh]
----
# Login with admin:org scope to manage org secrets:
gh auth login --scopes "admin:org"

# Set a secret only for private repos, and prompt for secret value:
gh secret set --org ORG_NAME SECRET_NAME

# Set a secret for public, private and internal repos:
gh secret set --org ORG_NAME --visibility all SECRET_NAME

# Set a secret for specific repos:
gh secret set --org ORG_NAME SECRET_NAME --repos repo1-name,repo2-name

# List all secrets for an organization:
gh secret list --org ORG_NAME
----

Secrets are accessed via the secrets context, eg. `${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}`.
You can pass them into any step's shell commands or reused actions. Example:

[source,yaml]
----
name: Example using secret as input

on: [push]

jobs:
  use-secret-as-input:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use secret as input
        uses: example/action@v1
        with:
          api-key: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
----

You can also pass secrets into env vars:

[source,yaml]
----
name: Example using secret as input

on: [push]

jobs:
  use-secret-as-input:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run a script using a secret
        run: |
          echo "Using API key: $API_KEY"
        env:
          API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
----

=== Special secrets

There are a handful of special secrets that the GitHub Actions runners look for:

* `ACTION_RUNNER_DEBUG`: Set to `true` at the repository level to enable
  diagnostic logging for runners.

* `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG`: Set to `true` at the repository level to enable
  diagnostic logging for steps.

Diagnostic logging provides additional debug logging from a workflow, which can
be useful to diagnose issues with a workflow. Additional debug logging can be
enabled for runs and steps.

== Configuration variables

Configuration variables are variables that allow you to access non-sensitive
information in your GitHub Actions workflows.

Variables are accessed via the `vars` context, eg. `${{ vars.MY_VAR }}`.

As with secrets, variables can be set at multiple levels, with the lower-level
ones overrides higher-level variables where there are name collisions:

* Organization-level variables
* Repository-level variables
* Environment-level variables

[source,sh]
----
# Add variable value for the current repository, via interactive prompt.
gh variable set MY_VAR

# Read variable value from an environment variable.
gh variable set MY_VAR --body "$ENV_VAR"

# Read variable value from a file.
gh variable set MY_VAR < file.txt

# Set multiple variables imported from the ".env" file.
gh variable set -f .env

# Set variable for a specific deployment environment in the current repository.
gh variable set MY_VAR --env ENV_NAME

# Set organization-level variable, visible to both public and private repos.
gh variable set MY_VAR --org ORG_NAME --visibility all

# Set organization-level variable, visible to specific repositories.
gh variable set MY_VAR --org ORG_NAME --repos repo1-name,repo2-name
----

== Environment vars

=== Default env vars

GitHub sets LOTS of environment variables by default, which are all available
from every step in every workflow â€“ but only via the runner that is executing
the job, so in effect the env vars are available only from the `run` attribute.
The default env vars are case-sensitive, and they refer to configuration values
for the system and the current user.

Commonly-used default env vars include:

* `GITHUB_REF`
* `GITHUB_TOKEN`

To use a default env var from `run`, prefix it with the `$` sign.

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  prod-check:
    steps:
      - run: echo "Deploying to production server on branch $GITHUB_REF"
----

While env vars are only available via the runner, you can also access some
environment information via _contexts_, and these are more widely available, eg.
you can use them in conditionals. In the following example, the `github.ref`
context is used to check the branch that triggered the workflow. Subsequently,
the env var `$GITHUB_REF` is used to log the same branch name in the runner.

[source,yaml]
----
name: CI
on: push
jobs:
  prod-check:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Deploying to production server on branch $GITHUB_REF"
----

[TIP]
======
It is RECOMMENDED to use the default env vars to reference the runner's
filesystem, rather than using hard-coded file paths.
======

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is a special environment variable that is automatically set
at the start of each workflow job. You can use the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to
authenticate with the `gh` CLI tool. Simply assign `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` to
a new env var called `GH_TOKEN`, which `gh` will automatically read and use
for authentication.

[source,yaml]
----
name: Open a new issue
on:
  - workflow_dispatch

jobs:
  open-issue:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      issues: write
    steps:
      - run: |
          gh issue --repo ${{ github.repository }} \
            create --title "New issue" --body "This is an issue!"
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
----

You can also use `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` with GitHub's REST API.

=== Custom env vars

You can define custom env vars inline within your workflows. To create a custom
env var, you define it in your workflow file using the `env` attribute. The
following example shows env vars set at the workflow level, job level, and step
level. As with default env vars, custom env vars are case-sensitive, thus
`$Your_Name` does not reference the same value as `$YOUR_NAME`.

[source,yaml]
----
name: Greeting on variable day

on:
  - workflow_dispatch

env:
  DAY_OF_WEEK: Monday

jobs:
  greeting_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      GREETING: Hello
    steps:
      - name: "Say hello"
        run: echo "$GREETING $Your_Name. Today is $DAY_OF_WEEK."
        env:
          Your_Name: Mona
----

Configuration variables and secrets can be used to set your custom
environment variables at runtime:

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      APP_ENV: ${{ vars.APP_ENV || "dev" }}
      DEBUG: ${{ vars.DEBUG || "false" }}
    steps:
      - name: Run workflow with parameters
        run: |
          # Use environment variables to control workflow behavior
          if [[ "$APP_ENV" == "production" && "$DEBUG" == "false" ]]; then
            echo "Running in production mode."
          else
            echo "Running in a different mode or with debugging enabled."
          fi
----

As with default env vars, you can access custom env vars from `run` scripts
using the normal Unix `$` prefix. You can also use the `env` context to access
custom env vars, which is more useful in conditional expressions.

[source,yaml]
----
name: Greeting on variable day

on:
  - workflow_dispatch

env:
  DAY_OF_WEEK: Monday

jobs:
  greeting_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      GREETING: Hello
    steps:
      - name: "Say hello"
        if: ${{ env.DAY_OF_WEEK == 'Monday' }}
        run: echo "$GREETING $YOUR_NAME. Today is $DAY_OF_WEEK."
        env:
          YOUR_NAME: Mona
----

You can also  dynamically set env vars during the execution of your workflows,
using the `GITHUB_ENV` special environment variable. This is useful for passing
values between steps, dynamically adjusting behavior based on runtime results,
or configuring tools and scripts executed by your workflow.

[source,yaml]
----
name: Set env vars example

on:
  - push

jobs:
  setup-and-use-env:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Set dynamic env var
        run: |
          echo "DYNAMIC_ENV_VAR=hello from GA" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      - name: Use dynamic env var
        run: |
          echo "Dynamic env var is $DYNAMIC_ENV_VAR"
----
