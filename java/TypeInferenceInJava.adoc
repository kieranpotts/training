= Type inference in Java

The Java compiler can infer the types of some variables based on assigned values.
This feature is called type inference.

This feature began in Java 8 when lambda expressions were introduced. In
lambda expressions, the type declarations for arguments were optional as the
compiler was designed to infer the argument types from the surrounding context.
Example:

[source,java]
----
interface A {
  void check(int num, String name);
}

class Demo {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    A obj = (num, name) -> System.out.println(num + " " + name);
    obj.check(10, "Hello");
  }
}
----

This feature was extended in Java 10. The extended feature is called *local
variable type inference* and it allows the compiler to infer the type of a local
variable from the value assigned to it. Example:

[source,java]
----
/* Previously: */
int i = 8;

/* From Java 10: */
var i = 8;
----

The syntax is further simplified for arrays:

[source,java]
----
/* Previously: */
int nums[] = new int[10];

/* From Java 10: */
var nums = new int[10];
----

The `var` keyword is used to declare a local variable with an inferred type.
When the compiler sees this keyword, it will infer the type of the variable
based on the data assigned to it. In the above example, `i` is inferred to be of
type `int`.

You can't use `var` on a local variable without initializing it. The following
code will not compile:

[source,java]
----
var i;
----

The introduction of local variable type inference in Java 10 was intended to
reduce Java's legendary verbosity, and so improve the readability of Java code.
After all, code is written once but read many times.

[source,java]
----
/* Less readable: */
ArrayList list = new ArrayList();

/* More readable: */
var list = new ArrayList();
----

Arguably, there is little difference in readability of the above code lines.
However, sometimes class names are very long, in which case writing a class name
twice on the same line _does_ greatly reduce readability.

You can still call variables `var` if you want, but this is not recommended â€“
it's confusing. We should treat `var` as a reserved keyword, though it is not.

[source,java]
----
/* This works but is bad practice. */
int var = 10;
----

Type inference is limited to local variables . It is not extended to class
instance variables, method parameters, or return types. This is a good design.
Local variables (within a method) exist only to serve the processing of data
through the method, and their types are usually clear from the immediate
context. By contrast, instance variables, say, are a form of data storage, and
therefore it is desirable to always be explicit about their expected types.

Even with the introduction of `var`, Java remains a strong statically-typed
language
