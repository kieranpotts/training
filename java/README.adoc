== Compilation and execution

[source,sh]
----
# Produces an artifact named <filename>.class
javac <filename>.java

# Run <filename>.class in the JVM.
java <filename>

Or use the single-command shortcut (which works from versions of Java â‰ˆv14).
This does not produce a built artifact, so this is intended only for use in
development. It works only when there is one file to compile.

[source,sh]
----
java <filename>.java
