/*
In Java, access modifiers can be applied to classes and their members (ie. their
attributes, methods, and constructors).

For classes, there's only one access modifier: `public`. By default, without a
modifier, a class is accessible only within its package. Adding the `public`
modifier makes the class accessible from absolutely everywhere.

Class members have three access modifiers: `private`, `protected`, and `public`.
The default behavior is that members (without modifiers) are quasi-public, in
the sense they are accessible from anywhere within the same package (which is
the same default behavior as classes themselves).

Adding one of the three access modifiers changes the scope of access to the
member, as follows:

* `private` members can be accessed only from within the same class.

* `protected` members can be accessed from anywhere within the same package
    (the default behavior), and in addition they can be accessed from any
    subclass, even subclasses defined in other packages.

* `public` members can be accessed from absolutely everywhere.

THe following table summarizes the access levels for class members (they default
and `public` options are also relevant for classes themselves):

| Accessible from:                  | `public` | `protected` | Default * | `private` |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | ----------- | --------- | --------- |
| The same class                    | Yes      | Yes         | Yes       | Yes       |
| A subclass in the same package    | Yes      | Yes         | Yes       | No        |
| Another class in the same package | Yes      | Yes         | Yes       | No        |
| A subclass in another package     | Yes      | Yes         | No        | No        |
| Another class in another package  | Yes      | No          | No        | No        |

(* No modifier.)
