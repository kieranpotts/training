= AWS users

== Root user

The root user is created when you first sign up for a new AWS organization
account. It has full access to all AWS services and resources in the account.

After signing up, you SHOULD enable Multi-Factor Authentication for the
root user account, and make sure that the root user does not have any access
keys.

Subsequently to access the AWS Management Console, it is better to do so using
a dedicated IAM (Identity and Access Management) admin users, rather than the
root user. Go to *Users* > *Add Users*. Enter a username and select the option
to give the user access to the AWS Management Console. Choose *Create an IAM
user* and set a password.

On the *Set permissions* screen, select *Attach policies directly*, and choose
*AdministratorAccess*.

On completion, new IAM users will be given a dedicated URL they can use to
access the AWS Management Console. This URL just auto-populates the account
number.
