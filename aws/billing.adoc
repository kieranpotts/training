== Billing alerts

It is RECOMMENDED to setup billing alarms, so you don't spend more than you have
budgeted for on AWS resources.

Go to *Billing* > *Billing preferences*. Under *Alert preferences*, select
*Receive CloudWatch billing alerts*, and optionally *Receive AWS Free Tier alerts*
too.

Now that alerts are enabled, you need to create some alerts. Go to *Cloudwatch*
> *Create alarms*. You must be in the region US East (N. Virginia) (`us-east-1`)
to create billing alarms. Billing metrics are stored in this region. You can
then choose *Billing* as your alarm metric. Set the threshold.
