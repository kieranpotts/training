= Slots

A shadow root can also include content from its containing document (or
document fragment - ie. whatever is DOM is immediately "outside" of the shadow
root).

This is sone using the `<slot>` element. *A slot allows content outside of
the shadow root to be rendered inside the shadow root's DOM tree.* It's similar
in concept to Angular's `ng-transclude` directive or React's `children` prop.

A shadow root can have any number of slot elements, which can be distinguished
with a `name` attribute. The first slot inside of the shadow root without a
name will be the default slot, and all content not otherwise assigned will flow
inside of that node.
