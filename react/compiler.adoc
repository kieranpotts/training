= React compiler (React v19)

React v19's new compiler is an evolution of something that was released a number
of years ago called React Forget.

Essentially, React Compiler can take your React code and compile it down to
something that is much more efficient, and much smaller in terms of the amount
of code that is shipped to the browser, but which still works the same way.

The big advantage of the React Compiler is that we're not going to need APIs
like `React.memo()`, `React.useMemo`, or `React.useCallback` any more. The
compiler will figure out when to memoize things and when not to, and
automatically handle these use cases to fine-tune performance.
