= React basics

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML, with a
few key differences. It gets compiled to a plain JavaScript object, which you
can see by simply console logging it.

[source,jsx]
----
/* Where JSX is assigned to a variable, it MUST be wrapped in parentheses. */
const page = (
  <div>
    <h1 className="header">This is JSX</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  </div>
)

/* This will log the compiled JSX object to the console. */
console.log(page)

/* To render JSX to the DOM, the JSX structure MUST have exactly one root node. */
ReactDOM.render(
  page,
  document.getElementById("root")
)
----

The `ReactDOM` API changed in React v18, and the `render` method is now
deprecated. We MUST use the new `createRoot` method instead. The path to the
`ReactDOM` import is also different.

.index.js
[source,js]
----
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client"

// â€¦

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"))
    .render(navbar)
