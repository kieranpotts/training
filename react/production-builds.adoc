= Production builds

.index.html
[source,html]
----
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <!-- The compiled JavaScript file is included here. -->
    <script src="index.dist.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
----

Install the "react" and "react-dom" packages as production dependencies. Then
import `React` from the "react" package and `ReactDOM` from the "react-dom"
package in your JSX files.

Even though `React` is not explicitly used in the following example, it will
be once the file is compiled. It is this API that is used to create React
components from JSX syntax.

.index.jsx
[source,jsx]
----
import React from "react"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom"

const navbar = (
  <nav>
    <h1>Bob's Bistro</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Menu</li>
      <li>About</li>
      <li>Contact</li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
)

ReactDOM.render(navbar, document.getElementById("root"))
----

From React v17, the explicit import of `React` is no longer required. And
the `ReactDOM` API changed in React v18. So the above code will need to be
refactored as follows:

.index.jsx
[source,jsx]
----
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client"

const navbar = (
  <nav>
    <h1>Bob's Bistro</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Menu</li>
      <li>About</li>
      <li>Contact</li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
)

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"))
root.render(navbar)
----

== Building with Vite

Vite is recommended for production builds. Internally it uses a transpiler
(esbuild, rather than Babel) to convert JSX to JavaScript, and it also does
bundling to create optimized for production builds. Vite also comes with a
development server that supports hot module reloading.

To scaffold a new Vite project, run:

[source,bash]
----
$ npm init vite@latest
----

Then follow the prompts to create a new project. Select "react" as the
framework when prompted.

Vite requires some subtle changes to how you compose React components.
For example, any images referenced in JSX must be imported at the top of the
file, so the bundler knows where to source the images from.

[source,jsx]
----
import logo from "./my-logo.png"

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <header>
        <nav>
          <img src={logo} />
        </nav>
      </header>
      â€¦
    </div>
  )
}
----

External CSS files need to be explicitly imported, too:

[source,jsx]
----
import "./main.css"
----
