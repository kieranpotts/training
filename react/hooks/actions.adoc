= Actions

Actions are a new concept planned for release in React v19. This hook makes it
easier to update state in response to form actions.

Previously, to synchronize the data submitted via a form with your React
application's state, you would use an `onSubmit` callback, which would
`event.preventDefault` and then update the state based on the form data.

[source,jsx]
----
function App() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState('')
  const [name, setName] = useState(
    () => JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('name')) || ''
  )

  function handleChange(event) {
    setInput(event.target.value)
  }

  async function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    try {
      const newName = await updateNameInDb(input)
      setName(newName)
      setInput('')
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error.message)
    }
  }

  return (
    <>
      <p>Your name is: {name}</p>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          type="text"
          value={input}
          onChange={handleChange}
          required
        />
        <button type="submit">Update</button>
      </form>
    <>
  )
}
----


In React 19, we will be able to replace the `onSubmit` callback with an `action`
callback. This callback will receive the form's native Form Data object.

[source,html]
----
<form action={...}>
----

Interestingly, React is piggybacking on the native capabilities of the web
platform in its implementation of the `action` attribute The `action` attribute
is actually native to HTML `<form>` elements. Traditionally it is given a string
value which represents a URL to which the form data is sent. React allows you
to set a callback function instead, and that callback receives the form's native
Form Data object.

As shown in the refactored code below, we no longer need to `useState` to keep
track of the form's state. In this particular case, we no longer need to track
the value of the input field.

[source,js]
----
function App() {

  const [name, setName] = useState(
    () => JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('name')) || ''
  )

  async function formAction(formData) {
    try {
      const newName = await updateNameInDb(formData.get('name'))
      setName(newName)
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error.message)
    }
  }

  return (
    <>
      <p>Your name is: {name}</p>
      <form action={formAction}>
        <input
          type="text"
          name="name"
          required
        />
        <button type="submit">Update</button>
      </form>
    <>
  )
}
----

This is a big improvement in React's usability, because it is tapping into the
native capabilities of the web platform. In this case, native `<form>` elements
are left to manage their own state, and we don't need to duplicate that state
in our React components that use `<form>` elements.

This new hook makes it much easier to work with forms in React, and we can
remove a whole lot of boilerplate code that we previously needed to write
for form handling.

Notice that, so far, we're not even directly calling the `useActionState`
hook. But we're already using this feature via our callback for the `action`
attribute on the `<form>` element.

The `userActionState()` function itself becomes useful when we want to
manage error and loading states for our forms. Previously, to manage loading
and error states in a React component, we would have to do a lot of explicit
state management, like this:

[source,jsx]
----
function App() {

  const [name, setName] = useState(
    () => JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('name')) || ''
  )

  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)
  const [error, setError] = useState(null)

  async function formAction(formData) {
    setLoading(true)
    setError(null)
    try {
      const newName = await updateNameInDb(formData.get('name'))
      setName(newName)
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error.message)
      setError(error)
    } finally {
      setLoading(false)
    }
  }

  // â€¦
}
----

In React 19, the `useActionState()` function will return three values, which
represent:

* The form's current state.
* The wrapping action function to be called when the form is submitted (this
  must get referenced from `<form action="">`.
* A boolean value that indicates whether the action is pending.

The following code shows the refactoring using `useActionState()`.

[source,jsx]
----
import { useState, useActionState } from "react"

function App() {

  const [state, actionFunction, isPending] = useActionState(
    updateState,
    { // Initial state
      error: null,
      name: JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('name')) || ''
    }
  )

  async function updateState(prevState, formData) {
    try {
      const newName = await updateNameInDb(formData.get('name'))
      return { name: newName }
    } catch (error) {
      return { ...prevState, error }
    }
  }

  return (
    <>
      <p>Your name is: {state.name}</p>

      {isPending && <p>Loading...</p>}

      <form action={actionFunction}>
        <input
          type="text"
          name="name"
          required
        />
        <button type="submit">Update</button>
        {!isPending && state.error && <p>{state.error.message}</p>}
      </form>
    <>
  )
}
----

Notice how error handling is implemented within our custom `updateState`
function. It's just updating the form's state in the normal way, adding
an error message, and we get complete control over how the rendering
responds to that state.
