= Props

In React, components can receive data from their parent components. This data is
passed as props.

The following example shows four instances of a `Contact` component, each of
which receives different data via props – which are the equivalent of attributes
in native HTML elements.

[source,jsx]
----
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="contacts">
      <Contact
        img="./images/mr-whiskerson.png"
        name="Mr. Whiskerson"
        phone="(212) 555-1234"
        email="mr.whiskaz@catnap.meow"
      />
      <Contact
        img="./images/fluffykins.png"
        name="Fluffykins"
        phone="(212) 555-2345"
        email="fluff@me.com"
      />
      <Contact
        img="./images/felix.png"
        name="Felix"
        phone="(212) 555-4567"
        email="thecat@hotmail.com"
      />
      <Contact
        img="./images/pumpkin.png"
        name="Pumpkin"
        phone="(0800) CAT KING"
        email="pumpkin@scrimba.com"
      />
    </div>
  )
}
----

The `Contact` component looks like this:

[source,jsx]
----
export default function Contact(props) {
  return (
    <div className="contact-card">
      <img src={props.img}/>
      <h3>{props.name}</h3>
      <div className="info-group">
        <img src="./images/phone-icon.png" />
        <p>{props.phone}</p>
      </div>
      <div className="info-group">
        <img src="./images/mail-icon.png" />
        <p>{props.email}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
----

Alternatively, the props can be destructured in the function signature,
into individual variables:

[source,jsx]
----
export default function Contact({img, name, phone, email}) {
  return (
    <div className="contact-card">
      <img src={img}/>
      <h3>{name}</h3>
      <div className="info-group">
        <img src="./images/phone-icon.png" />
        <p>{phone}</p>
      </div>
      <div className="info-group">
        <img src="./images/mail-icon.png" />
        <p>{email}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
----

[TIP]
======
It is RECOMMENDED to stick with a single `props` object. This will make it easier
to distinguish between props and other local variables you may define within
the scope of the component. It also makes it a little easier to extend components
with additional props in the future.

On the other hand, one of the advantages of destructing the props in the
function signature is that it makes it easier to see what props are being used
by the component.
======

Another common pattern, for complex components that require a lot of props, like
this…

[source,jsx]
----
const cards = data.map(item => {
  return (
    <Card
      key={item.id}
      coverImg={item.coverImg}
      rating={item.rating}
      reviewCount={item.reviewCount}
      location={item.location}
      title={item.title}
      price={item.price}
      available={item.available}
    />
  )
})
----

… is to refactor the component's props into a single object, like this:

[source,jsx]
----
const cards = data.map(item => {
  return (
    <Card
      key={item.id}
      item={item}
    />
  )
})
----

This pattern can work particularly well with TypeScript, where you can define
the shape of the `item` object using an interface.

Alternatively, you can use the spread operator to pass all the properties of the
`item` object as individual props, like this:

[source,jsx]
----
const cards = data.map(item => {
  return (
    <Card
      key={item.id}
      {...item}
    />
  )
})
----

This requires not changes to the `Card` component itself, but only changes to
the calling code. All the properties of the `item` object will be passed as
props, but any props that are not used by the component will simply be ignored -
there is no harm in passing extra props.

''''

The main difference between props and attributes is that React supports _any_
JS data type to be passed as prop values, while HTML attributes are limited to
strings. Where non-string values are passed as props, the value needs to be
enclosed in curly braces, so that React can evaluate the expression. Whatever
value the JS expression resolves to will be the value that is passed to the
prop.
